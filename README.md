pitch of human voice is used to classify the gender(Male/Female/Unknown)

- Calculates the pitch frequency of the voice.
- Classifies gender into Male, Female, or Unknown.

The gender is determined based on the pitch frequency range:

Gender  Pitch Range (Hz)    

Female  : 165 Hz â€“ 255 Hz       
Male    :  Below 165 Hz          
Unknown : Above 255 Hz
